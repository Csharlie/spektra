# Spektra Project Templates

This directory is reserved for **project scaffolding templates** only.

## Purpose

Templates in this directory are used to scaffold complete project starters.
They contain the initial file structure, configuration, and boilerplate code
for new Spektra-based projects.

## NOT for UI Components

- This directory is NOT for UI page compositions (use `engine/packages/core/components/layouts` instead)
- This directory is NOT for React components
- The word "template" in Spektra ONLY refers to project scaffolding

## Current Status

Currently empty. Future project templates will be added here.
