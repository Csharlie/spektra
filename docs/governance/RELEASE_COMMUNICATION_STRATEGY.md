# Release Communication Strategy

**Status**: Enforced  
**Owner**: Platform Team

---

## Purpose

This strategy formally separates **version creation** (technical state) from **release communication** (business event). Not all versions are communicated. Not all versions require stakeholder attention. This policy protects business communication from version inflation while maintaining technical precision.

**Version ≠ Release Announcement**

---

## Core Principle

The Spektra engine follows a **high-frequency versioning model** where:
- Every merged change creates a version
- Versions document the current state
- Communication is selective based on impact

**Deterministic versioning does NOT require deterministic communication.**

---

## Definitions

### Version
A **technical state identifier** created automatically by semantic-release.
- Represents a point in the codebase history
- Always documented in CHANGELOG
- Always tagged in Git
- Does NOT require human communication

**Example**: `engine-v1.2.8`

### Release Announcement
A **communicated event** where stakeholders are informed of a version's existence and significance.
- Selective based on impact
- Requires human decision
- May cover multiple versions
- Targets specific audiences

**Example**: "Engine 1.3.0 introduces new theming capabilities"

## Communication Decision Matrix

| Version Type | Features | Breaking Changes | Bug Fixes | Maintenance | Communication Required? |
|--------------|----------|------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **MAJOR** | Any | YES | Any | Any | **MANDATORY** |
| **MINOR** | YES | No | Any | Any | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **PATCH** | No | No | YES | Any | **CONDITIONAL** |
| **PATCH** | No | No | No | YES | **OPTIONAL** |

### Decision Rules

#### MANDATORY Communication
- All MAJOR versions
- Any version with breaking changes
- Any version that affects consumer APIs

**Rationale**: Consumers must be aware of changes requiring action.

#### RECOMMENDED Communication
- MINOR versions with new features
- Bug fixes that resolve known issues
- Performance improvements with measurable impact

**Rationale**: Consumers benefit from awareness of new capabilities.

#### CONDITIONAL Communication
- PATCH versions with critical bug fixes
- Security-related PATCH versions
- Bug fixes to recently reported issues

**Rationale**: Depends on severity and urgency.

#### OPTIONAL Communication
- Maintenance-only PATCH versions
- Internal refactoring versions
- Dependency updates without API impact

**Rationale**: Low external value; CHANGELOG is sufficient.

---

## Communication Channels

### Internal Channels

#### Platform Team Slack
**Audience**: Engine maintainers  
**Frequency**: All versions  
**Format**: Automated notification from CI

**Example**:
```
🚀 Engine v1.2.8 released
📝 Maintenance: Dependency updates
🔗 https://github.com/org/spektra/releases/tag/engine-v1.2.8
```

#### Project Team Channels
**Audience**: Consumer project teams (baseline and other client projects)  
**Frequency**: MINOR and MAJOR versions only  
**Format**: Manual notification with migration notes

**Example**:
```
📢 Engine v1.3.0 Available

New features:
- useThemeContext hook
- DataGrid component

Migration: No breaking changes
Docs: https://...
```

### External Channels

#### Release Notes (GitHub)
**Audience**: All stakeholders  
**Frequency**: All versions  
**Format**: Automatically generated by semantic-release

**Content**: Full CHANGELOG entry for the version.

#### Stakeholder Announcements
**Audience**: Business stakeholders, product owners  
**Frequency**: MAJOR and significant MINOR versions only  
**Format**: Summarized email or meeting update

**Example**:
```
Subject: Engine 2.0.0 Released - Breaking Changes

The platform team has released Engine 2.0.0 with the following 
breaking changes that require consumer project updates:

- Removed useLegacyTheme (deprecated since 1.8.0)
- Button component API changes

Migration timeline: Projects must update by Feb 1, 2026.
Support: Platform team office hours every Tuesday.
```

## Communication Templates

### Template: MAJOR Version
```markdown
# Engine {version} Released — Breaking Changes

**Release Date**: {date}
**Migration Deadline**: {date + 3 weeks}

## Breaking Changes
{list breaking changes with migration steps}

## New Features
{list new features}

## Migration Guide
{link to migration documentation}

## Support
{contact information}
```

### Template: MINOR Version
```markdown
# Engine {version} Available — New Features

**Release Date**: {date}

## What's New
{list features with examples}

## Bug Fixes
{list notable fixes}

## How to Update
{update instructions}
```

### Template: PATCH Version (if communicated)
```markdown
# Engine {version} — Critical Fix

**Release Date**: {date}

## Fix Summary
{describe the fix and its impact}

## Affected Versions
{list versions with the bug}

## Update Recommended
{update instructions}
```

---

## Batched Communication

### When to Batch
Multiple PATCH versions with only Maintenance entries can be batched into a single communication.

**Example**:
```
Versions 1.2.8, 1.2.9, 1.2.10 (Jan 8-10):
- Routine dependency updates
- Internal performance improvements
- No API changes

Current stable: v1.2.10
```

### When NOT to Batch
- Versions with breaking changes (always communicate immediately)
- Versions with user-facing bug fixes (communicate individually)
- MINOR versions (each deserves dedicated communication)

---

## Silent Releases

A **silent release** is a version that:
- Is documented in CHANGELOG
- Is tagged in Git
- Is available for consumption
- Is NOT actively communicated to stakeholders

**Silent releases are valid and expected.**

### Criteria for Silent Release
- Maintenance-only changes
- Internal refactoring
- Dependency updates without consumer impact
- CI/CD improvements

### Example
```markdown
## [1.2.8] - 2026-01-09

### Maintenance
- Updated React to 18.3.1
- Improved build performance
- Updated CI pipeline configuration
```

**Communication**: None required. Version exists for audit trail and state documentation.

---

## Communication Timing

### Immediate (within 1 hour)
- MAJOR versions with breaking changes
- Security-related patches
- Critical bug fixes

### Same Day
- MINOR versions with features
- Notable bug fixes

### Weekly Digest (optional)
- Multiple maintenance PATCH versions
- Low-priority updates

---

## Engine as Platform Context

The Spektra engine is an **internal platform**, not a public library. Communication strategy reflects this:

### Internal vs External
- **Internal**: Direct communication possible; synchronous updates feasible
- **External**: Would require broader announcements; not applicable yet

### Consumer Awareness
- Consumer projects depend on engine via package.json
- Projects can specify version ranges or pin versions
- Communication helps projects decide when to update

### Versioning Rhythm
- High-frequency technical versioning
- Low-frequency business communication
- This separation is intentional and healthy

---

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Announce Every Version
**Problem**: Communication fatigue; stakeholders ignore announcements.

**Correct Approach**: Selective communication based on impact.

### ❌ Skip Documenting Silent Releases
**Problem**: Audit trail gaps; unclear version history.

**Correct Approach**: Document all versions in CHANGELOG; communicate selectively.

### ❌ Delay Breaking Change Communication
**Problem**: Consumer projects break unexpectedly.

**Correct Approach**: Immediate communication for MAJOR versions.

### ❌ Over-Explain Maintenance Versions
**Problem**: Confusion about why maintenance versions exist.

**Correct Approach**: Document in CHANGELOG; do not communicate unless asked.

| Version creation | semantic-release (automated) | Every merge to main |
| CHANGELOG generation | semantic-release (automated) | Every version |
| GitHub Release Notes | semantic-release (automated) | Every version |
| Internal Slack notification | CI automation | Every version |
| Project team communication | Platform team | MINOR/MAJOR versions |
| Stakeholder announcements | Platform team lead | MAJOR versions |

## Metrics and Review

### Communication Effectiveness Metrics
- Stakeholder awareness of breaking changes (target: 100%)
- Time to consumer project updates (target: < 2 weeks for MAJOR)
- False positive communications (target: < 10% of announcements)

### Quarterly Review
Platform team reviews:
- Communication patterns
- Stakeholder feedback
- Version frequency vs communication frequency
- Adjustment needs

---

## Policy Stability

This strategy is considered **stable and enforced**. Changes require:
- Platform team consensus
- Documentation update
- Stakeholder notification
